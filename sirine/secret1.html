													<h1>— Date unknown, location: three veils east of Narthul's Hollow —</h1>

													<p>I can barely hold the pen. The gloom presses heavier than usual tonight. Even my eyes—accustomed as they are—strain to see more than shifting silhouettes. Maelen says it’s the Bodak. That its presence frays the edges of the dark itself. He’s right. I feel it, behind us. Like a thought you didn’t think, whispering to be let in.</p>
													<p>We’ve traveled six dusks without rest. Fira has held Qraco close to her breast the whole way, even through the mistslicks and the stinging winds. Our son hasn’t cried once. Perhaps even he understands what hunts us.</p>
													<p>Maelen believes the veil is thinnest near the Cradle of Glass—a jagged fault where light and shadow dance like wounded things. If we reach it, if I can get them through… Maybe. Just maybe.</p>
													<p>But the dark is hungrier than our hope. I heard it an hour past—wet breath, bones cracking softly under unseen feet. It’s closer now.</p>
													<p>If these are my final words, let them bear truth: Fira was fearless. Maelen did not turn. And Qraco—our boy—was kissed by something greater than fear. When the Bodak found us, it unmade everything. The screaming stopped before it ever began.</p>
													<p>But the light. Gods. I saw it. Just before the end. A ribbon of pale fire cleaved the dusk and swallowed Qraco whole. Not the Bodak. Not death. Something else. Something watching.</p>
													<p>If he lives, if he breathes in the world beyond the veil… then it was worth it.</p>
													<p>I hear it now. Closer. I will not run. Let it know I died standing.</p>
