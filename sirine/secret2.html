									<h1>Experiment Log #042</h1>
									<div><b>Lead Researcher:</b> Initiate-Prime Vareth Tonn</div>
									<div><b>Field Assistant:</b> Initiate-Cadet Hessa Rul</div>
									<div><b>Location:</b> Subterranean Facility Theta-9, Chamber IV</div>
									<div><b>Subject:</b> Black Ichor Sample 17-C (extracted from corrupted ridgewolf
										carcass,
										recovered north of Brann Marsh)</div>
									<div><b>Objective:</b> Controlled exposure of ichor to baseline biological tissue to
										study
										corruptive rate, neural override potential, and viability for martial
										application.</div>
									<p> </p>
									<p><b>10:02</b> – Sample 17-C removed from cold storage. Viscosity unchanged.
										Assistant Rul
										reports faint resonant vibration in containment vial. Noted. May require runic
										insulation to limit further ambient bleed.</p>
									<p><b>10:07</b> – Baseline tissue sample (porcine muscle, preserved) placed in
										infusion
										matrix. 1.5 ml of ichor applied via calibrated drip.</p>
									<p><b>10:10</b> – Immediate response observed. Tissue begins to animate despite lack
										of
										neural structure. Uncontrolled convulsions result in partial destruction of
										matrix. Black growths begin to spread from point of contact—non-organic, likely
										crystallized necroplasm.</p>
									<p><b>10:12</b> – Rul notes auditory distortion in chamber: low-frequency murmuring.
										Confirmed. No discernible language structure. Possibly empathic residue or
										latent psychic discharge. Standard counter-wards activated.</p>
									<p><b>10:15</b> – Animation ceases. Tissue mass enters rapid decay phase. Residual
										ichor
										remains active, attempting to bond with floor tile grout. Sample removed and
										incinerated. Floor segment flagged for replacement.</p>
									<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Sample 17-C retains latent autonomous properties even when
										separated
										from host. While full control was not achieved, short-term animation and
										aggression amplification are promising. Further experiments recommended with
										living subjects and refined binding glyphs. Cadet Rul suggests exploring
										mirrored runes from the old Sable Lexicon to suppress decay onset—approved for
										next trial.</p>
									<p><b>Note:</b> Bodily contact with ichor remains prohibited. Acolyte Senn’s
										incident from
										Log #039 is not to be repeated.</p>

									<h1>Experiment Log #088</h1>
									<div><b>Lead Researcher:</b> Initiate-Prime Vareth Tonn</div>
									<div><b>Field Assistant:</b> Initiate-Cadet Hessa Rul</div>
									<div><b>Location:</b> Subterranean Facility Theta-9, Chamber VII-B</div>
									<div><b>Subject:</b> Human volunteer (designate: Subject H-03, former conscript, low
										cognitive resistance per pre-screening)</div>
									<div><b>Objective:</b> Evaluate physiological and cognitive impact of direct ichor
										injection. Determine viability of corruption retention without full mental
										dissolution. Combat capability evaluation pending.</div>
									<p> </p>
									<p><b>09:40</b> – Subject H-03 restrained and sedated. 5 ml of refined ichor (Batch
										21-R, siphoned from stabilized ridgewolf husk) injected intramuscularly in left
										deltoid. No immediate reaction beyond mild tremors.</p>
									<p><b>09:46</b> – Sedative wearing off faster than anticipated. Subject vocalizes in
										fragmented phrases: “pulling,” “through the mirror,” and “the second mouth.”
										Monitor notes cerebral temperature rising by 3.8°C. Internal warding reinforced.
									</p>
									<p><b>09:52</b> – Subject attempts to bite through restraints. Strength exceeds
										baseline; left wrist dislocated in process. Ichor visibly spreading beneath
										skin—black vascular patterns resembling branching root systems.</p>
									<p><b>10:01</b> – Subject enters catatonic state. Pupils dilated to full black.
										Heart rate irregular but sustained. Assistant Rul notes drop in ambient
										temperature; condensation forming along outer chamber walls. Not typical.</p>
									<p><b>10:07</b> – Subject suddenly rises unaided, despite full neuromuscular
										collapse noted in previous scans. Speech resumes: unfamiliar tongue, pattern
										consistent with pre-Lexicon glyphwork. Auto-recorders captured full audio. To be
										analyzed.</p>
									<p><b>10:09</b> – Subject strikes reinforced glass with bare hand. Fractures appear
										in wall, along with ichor bloom radiating from impact site. Containment glyphs
										fail in sequence—Glyphs 3, 6, and 11 lost coherence. Rul activates fail-safe
										seal. Subject immobilized via arc-blast. Body combusts; black ash remains.</p>
									<p><b>Postmortem Notes:</b> Neural override occurred faster than predicted. Subject
										retained human form for 11.5 minutes post-injection before total collapse of
										identity. Ichor exhibits both parasitic and preservative traits—attempting to
										maintain vessel while eroding autonomy. Result: partial success.</p>
									<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Cognitive retention insufficient. Martial application remains
										promising in short bursts, but current iterations yield unstable hosts.
										Recommend continuation with criminal stock, preferably those already exhibiting
										violent tendencies. Emotional suppression may slow identity erosion. Rul has
										drafted revised injection matrix with sympathetic glyphs to tether ego.
										Approved.</p>
