									<h2>Ancient Journal Entry</h2>

									<h2>Journal of Tathren Willowmere</h2>
									<h1>Day 12 of the Bleeding Moon, Year 412 of the Elder Cycle</h1>
									<p>It has been three moons since the Stillness fell upon Hollowshade Glade. I write
										this now by firelight, alone beneath a canopy that feels emptier than it ever
										has in my sixty winters. The forest grieves, and so do I.</p>
									<p>The others—my kin, my circle, my heart—they are still. Frozen as though caught
										mid-breath, eyes open, hands outstretched, in the moment the god died. I saw it
										happen. I was away from the Glade, gathering ironroot sap in the northern
										reaches, when the wind died mid-whistle and the birds fell silent. Even the
										insects ceased their song. The stillness was complete. And then I felt it: a
										tearing, like bark being peeled from my soul. Curchanus... gone.</p>
									<p>We had always believed He was eternal—Lord of the Wild Road, Master of Beasts,
										Endurer of Time. But something reached beyond the veil and undid Him. I do not
										know what. I only know that those closest to His sacred grove were taken by that
										final breath. Frozen where they stood. Not dead, no—there is still a hum in
										their bones, a flicker of His essence, like coals beneath ash. But unmoving.
										Unaging.</p>
									<p>I tried everything. Chants, blood rites, invocations in the old tongue. I even
										called to other gods, those we scorned in life. Silence answered. No wind, no
										song. Just silence.</p>
									<p>The Glade is a tomb now. I left offerings, recorded each name I could remember on
										birchbark, and placed it in the stone circle. I return each season,
										hoping—though hope is a stubborn weed in barren soil.</p>
									<p>Something powerful intervened that day. And if their stillness was meant as
										protection, or punishment, I cannot say. But I believe it was not the end. The
										wild does not lie still forever.</p>
									<p>If this journal is found, know this: Curchanus walked once, and His children did
										not die with Him. They wait. And when they wake… may the world be ready.</p>
									<p>—T.W.</p>
