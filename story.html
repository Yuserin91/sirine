									<h3>Act 1: Shadows in the Deep</h3>
									<p>
										The party begins their journey en route to Nargabund, a dwarven mining town,
										after hiring passage from the City of Mercy, Heydon. Upon arrival, they find the
										town in panic—only one miner from a recent expedition has returned. Mayor Drake
										Onyxbeard, more concerned with quelling unrest than investigating, offers the
										party 500 gold to look into the disappearances.
										Following leads, the party ventures into the mines and discovers a newly opened
										tunnel mentioned by the lone survivor. Inside, they encounter motes of darkness
										attracted to glowing crystals and hostile toward certain party members.
										Deeper in, they confront a corrupted bear, its face covered in inky ichor. As
										battle ensues, missing miners appear—also corrupted. After defeating the
										creatures, they find murals hinting at the origins of the Grand Aegis. An old
										man materializes, cryptic and seemingly non-hostile, commenting only on the
										murals’ importance.
										Back in town, they claim their reward. However, a few members secretly search
										the mayor's manor, finding a magical coffer rigged with a Sepia Snake Sigil, a
										calling card of the Red Mantis assassins. The party regroups at the tavern to
										rest.

									<h3>Act 2: Echoes of the Arcane</h3>
									<p>
										The next morning, a sparrow delivers a message to the party’s Druid: Dean
										Kirkaeus Montgomery of the Arcana Academy (missing for two weeks) requests a
										meeting in Wawold, the Oracle’s hometown.
										They buy a cart and an old workhorse—affectionately named Drue—and head to
										Wawold. There, they meet a man claiming to be Kirkaeus, though he offers few
										answers. He asks them to retrieve a magical artifact from a nearby Temple of
										Divination.
										Inside the temple, the party solves a puzzle and faces a hallway inducing
										traumatic visions. In the main chamber, a ritual is underway. When the party
										interferes, they are attacked by illusory copies of themselves. After disrupting
										the ritual, the caster regains consciousness, obsessively demanding the orb they
										retrieved, insisting no one else is “ready.”
										They take him back to Wawold and secure the orb at the Oracle’s childhood
										church. But Kirkaeus is nowhere to be found. Asking around, locals react with
										scorn—“Monty” is reviled and unwelcome in town.
										Suddenly, chaos erupts: the church is on fire. The priest and townsfolk are
										evacuating, but the orb is missing.

									<h3>Act 3: And Back Again</h3>
									<p>
										Returning to Nargabund in search of unanswered questions, the party discovers
										Mayor Onyxbeard missing and the town preparing funerals for the fallen miners.
										Investigating the caves once more, they encounter two mysterious individuals
										examining the corpse of the corrupted bear. A deadly battle breaks out—one foe
										is a brutal melee combatant, the other a necromancer in ornate robes.
										After defeating them, the party finds a mission directive linking the assailants
										to both the Red Mantis assassins and the Cult of Lamashtu. This strikes a
										personal chord: the Avenger is hunting Lamashtu worshippers, while the Druid
										seeks vengeance against the Red Mantis for the death of a friend.
